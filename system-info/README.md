## Purpose
Generate a basic Excel report of system resources and user/group information

I made this script just for testing the `pwd`, `grp`, `openpyxl`, and `humanize` modules.


## Usage
Just run the script without arguments and you'll get a sysinfo.xlsx file generated in the current directory.

```bash
./system_info.py
```
