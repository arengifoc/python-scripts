## Purpose
Sum items from column C of a spreadsheet

I made this script just for testing the `openpyxl` module.


## Usage
Just run the script against a XLSX file.

**Important:** Convert the example.csv file to XLSX format for testing this script.

```bash
./sum_items_from_excel.py <excel-file>
```
