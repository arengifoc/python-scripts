## Purpose
Organize logs in folders based on service name and count the errors present on them. Generate a report with the amount of errors per log file.

I made this script just for testing the `shutil`, `re`, and `pathlib` modules.


## Usage
Just run the script against a directory containing log files:

```bash
./order_log_files.py <log-directory>
```
