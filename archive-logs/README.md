## Purpose
Archive logs older than 7 days from a directory. It creates a compressed file with logs.

I made this script just for testing the `shutil`, `sys`, `zipfile`, `datetime` and `tempfile` modules.


## Usage
Just run the script against a directory containing log files:

```bash
./archive_logs.py <log-directory>
```
